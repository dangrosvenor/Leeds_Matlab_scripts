function [S]=Scrit(T,rd)
%Calculates critical supersaturation in % as
%function of dry radius in metres
%T in K and rd=dry radius in m.
% Using Eqn. (2) of Ghan (2011). N.B. - is a mistake in that formula -
% should be diameter instead of radius as stated in the paper.



%Ammonium sulphate
k=0.7; %as used in Ghan - N.B. replaces most of the B term in Eqn. (17.32) of Seinfeld and Pandis
    % B = k*D^3
Mw=18.02e-3; %molecular weight of water
zetasa = 0.8e-1;  % Surface tension at solution-air interface (Newtons/metre)
rhow=997.0;     % water density (kg/m3)
A=4*Mw*zetasa/(8.31*rhow*T);

%Eqn. (2) of Ghan (2011). :-
Sc = sqrt ( 4*A.^3 / (27*0.7*(rd*2).^3)) *100;
