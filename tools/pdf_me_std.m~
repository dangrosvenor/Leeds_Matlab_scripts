function [me,std] = pdf_me_std(x,F)
%function [me,std] = pdf_me_std(x,F)
%calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given 1D PDF (can be
%normalised or not) described by mid-points x and frequencies F

N = sum(F);
 me = sum(F.*x)./sum(F);
 
 
 std = sqrt (   sum( F.*(x-me).^2 , 1 ) ./ (N-1)   );
