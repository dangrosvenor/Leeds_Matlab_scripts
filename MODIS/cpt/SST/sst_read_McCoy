%Load data - note, there is also an SST2.mat file - not sure what this is?
%load('/home/disk/eos7/dtmccoy/research/SST/SST.mat')

%The Matlab file SST.mat contains the read in version with an SST array that is 360x180x1253. The 1253 is 1253/52 = 24.0962 years, which makes sense since is labelled as 1990 to present (i.e. 24 years if present is 2014).
%This is the same size as for the .nc file (sst.wkmean.1990-present.nc). Time convention is 
%  days since 1800-1-1 00:00:00
