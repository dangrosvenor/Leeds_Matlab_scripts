What's New
==========
Prior to release 0.40, H5DUMP relied upon HDF5INFO to provide the
metadata necessary, but now it now relies entirely on the low-level
interface.  Since it is not backwards compatible with prior releases,
the old version is provided in the obsolete directory.

Many test datasets included in test/data are produced by code generated
by The HDF Group's "HDF5 Examples" web page,
<http://www.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/UserSupport/examples-by-api/>.  The image
datasets were retrieved from The HDF Group's Image API tutorial at
<http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/h5image.html>
